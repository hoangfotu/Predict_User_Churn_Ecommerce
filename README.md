# User Churn Prediction Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict user churn using machine learning techniques. User churn refers to the phenomenon where users of a product or service stop using it over a given period of time. By accurately identifying potential churners, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them and mitigate revenue loss.

This repository contains the code and resources necessary to train and deploy a churn prediction model. The model is built on historical user data and utilizes various features to make accurate predictions.

## Features
Data preprocessing: The project includes scripts and functions to preprocess raw user data, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation.
Model training: The repository provides code to train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. Multiple algorithms and techniques can be experimented with to find the best-performing model.
Evaluation: The project includes evaluation metrics and scripts to assess the performance of the trained model. These metrics measure the accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant statistics.
Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make predictions on new user data.

## Resources
data/: This directory contains example user data for testing and development purposes.
