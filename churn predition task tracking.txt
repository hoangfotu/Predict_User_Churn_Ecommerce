1. QUESTIONS:
- Users who hasn't been active in the last X days are said to have churned (most likely to churn) => Find X??? => X=14
	+ all users in current year who active at least 2 days
	+ find the longest inactive period which are most likely to churn (which is X) done => X = 28 72%
	+ avg days between 2 consecutive active dates (take 90th percentile ) => done X = 14 90%
- Define problem
	+ input: users based feature:
			number of days since last active date => longer the time since last active day, more likely to churn
			number of active days in last 4 weeks from active date => more active days, less likely to churn
			engagement rate => more engagement, less likely to churn
			seniority (time from first to last active date) => more senior, less likely to churn
			
	+ output: Proba that an user churn in the next X days, 1W
		  proba in range(0,1)
		  proba > 0.5 => predict as churn 
	+ what to do after having the prediction?? => PN, email,...
	+ when to make prediction: once a week, once a month?
	
2. Key goals
- predict if user will leave in advance (customer churn) - ex: 1 week/ 2 weeks/1 month/3 months
- find out main reasons for churning

variables:
first date, number of clicks in active day, how many active days in a week, 
week day user/weekend user???, whether mobile users use mobile features,
search, query search, dowload...

number of event features user use
if user use a specific feature or not

4. Improvement
- check if user use browser to log in fb, gg account
- check if user turn on PN or not
- collect data for more features and action logs
